It's a simple web app that would have only two pages. And to keep things
simple all data entries will be done by the account office.

1. TA/DA entry page, that takes a TA/DA entry containing </br>
  a. Date of the entry</br>
  b. Employee name which is selected from previously stored employee list</br>
  c. Expenses </br>
  d. Also if the TA/DA is already paid or not.</br>

2. TA/DA history page, this page shows the previous TA/DA entries sorted by date first. In the Paid column there should be a provision for changing unpaid entry to paid
entry, in case it is paid later.
